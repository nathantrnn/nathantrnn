# 👋 Hey there, I’m Nathan Tran!

## About Me  
**Husband, Father, Servant of God**  
I kinda just love playing with data and staying curious about everything. I build pipelines and craft data models by day, play piano by night. You’ll either find me DJing beats 🎧 or fine-tuning my car in the garage 🛠️ on weekends (my neighbors are pretty cool about it 😬).

## 🌱 Fun Facts  
- 🎹 data science is my jam, but let’s be real—nothing beats the thrill of nailing a perfect piano chord.  
- 🚗 my car might go 0-60 in seconds, but debugging a dataset can feel like 0-forever.  
- 🎧 I may tune predictive models and engines, but my Spotify playlists? Pure chaos.
